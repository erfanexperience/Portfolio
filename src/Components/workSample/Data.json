    "Description": "During this four-month project, I designed Gelato House Franchise Ltd's ice cream ordering app, giving users a fun four-step flow to create and order their customized ice cream. I conducted landscape analysis and user research to know what features align with users' needs. I worked with Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop to build the prototype and final designs.",

I aimed for a simple, clean, and elegant look. I first created the design in Figma and then built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also made an effort to improve my code by using more professional approaches, like custom properties and utility classes.",
